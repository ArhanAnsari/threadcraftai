- intro
The AI landscape is changing rapidly, and people are going wild with this, bringing a lot of tools we never could have imagined. In this video, I will teach you a step-by-step way on how to build your first AI SaaS that has the potential to be a passive income for you. Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you ThreadCraftAI.

This is a very simple and basic landing page that highlights all the important aspects of this project, like the ability to generate a Twitter thread, Instagram caption, and LinkedIn post using our AI.

I have signed up with Clerk authentication already, and I can click on "Generate Content" now to start generating content.

Everything here is responsive.

On this dashboard page, I have the ability to generate a Twitter thread, Instagram caption, and a LinkedIn post.

With the free tier, I only have 50 points, and I have to subscribe to get more points.
When I click on "Get More Points," it takes me to this page using Stripe. Users can use their credit card to subscribe to our platform to get more points.

So let's enter a fake credit card number here and subscribe.
We now have more points.

The content type dropdown shows all the media we can generate content for. So let's test how to generate a Twitter thread.

Enter a prompt, and using the power of Gemini AI, we are able to generate a thread on the fly, which users can copy and paste on Twitter, which is now X but i still call it twitter by the way.

Awesome! Users can do the same for LinkedIn posts and Instagram posts.

I assure you of a beginner-friendly, step-by-step guide on building a software as a service using Stripe for payment, Clerk for user authentication, and Drizzle ORM for storing data.

Without much ado, let's get right in.
